I have fallen down a bit of a rabbit hole. Said rabbit hole is around disabling JavaScript to view certain websites. All as part of a privacy movement originally started by GNU. 

My first experience of this movement was [HeydonWorks](https://heydonworks.com). Which just proves that you don't need JavaScript to have a beautiful website.

I had a look at how [The Self-Hosting Blog](https://theselfhostingblog.com) performs. And well, not too great.

This website however... No change. ðŸ™‚

Try it, try disabling JavaScript for your browser and view your website. Do you really need JavaScript on your site?
