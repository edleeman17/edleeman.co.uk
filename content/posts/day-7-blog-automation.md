title: "Day 7 - Blog Automation"

I have recently discovered that a lot of my posts over at [The Self-Hosting Blog](https://theselfhostingblog.com) follow the same passage.

1. Introduction about the Software
2. Provisioning your server
3. Installing prerequisite requirements
4. Installing *the thing*
5. Configuring Nginx
6. Port forwarding
7. Certbot
8. Recap

The only thing that really changes is step 4, maybe step 3 depending on whether Docker is required or not.

Why aren't I automating this.

I think I know why, the content will be shite. It'll lack personal touch.

Yes it's repetitive, but then again, the service that I am providing is to walk someone through how to set this stuff up. It is very similar between projects.
If I was to extract the repetitive steps into another blog post, my main blog posts would lack the content. It'll just be "Run this Docker Compose script".

Basically I keep contradicting myself. I'm worried about SEO rankings if I plagiarise my own content too much. But I'm also worried about lacking the content to be ranked by SEO.

I think my posts perform better when I write them from scratch. My tutorials on self-hosting [Standard Notes](https://theselfhostingblog.com/posts/how-to-completely-self-host-standard-notes/) and [Bitwarden](https://theselfhostingblog.com/posts/how-to-self-host-bitwarden-on-ubuntu-server/) are on the first page of Google.

I'm trying to balance time with reward. I think I need to pick one.

Let me know your thoughts below if you have any.

Laters!
