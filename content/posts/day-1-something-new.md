## Hello

Hello, this is my first post in the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) challenge. The brainchild of [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk).

I intend to use this space as a chance to improve my writing skills over at [The Self-Hosting Blog](https://theselfhostingblog.com).

I often find that I struggle to put my thoughts onto paper, and when re-reading what I have written, I feel like it was written by a 5 year old. I would like to improve how I come across on the internet and become a trusted source of knowledge to anyone who wants to know what I have to say.

My main interests are around Self-Hosting, hence The Self-Hosting Blog. It gets a good amount of traffic to a few of my self-hosting tutorials. But I feel like there is something missing, It just doesn't *scream* quality. Maybe I need to spend more time on posts? Maybe I need to share my posts before publishing them. I need someone who isn't going to be my friend about it, and tell me straight whether it's a rubbish bit of writing.

## I don't know

Dunno, I don't know, I don't really know. I need to sit down and think about what I want to do.

## Anyway,

Anyway, I'm Ed, Software Engineer based in the UK. Linux hobbyist by night. Privacy advocate, always. Hit me up if you want to chat.
