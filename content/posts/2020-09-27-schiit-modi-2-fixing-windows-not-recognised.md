## Sorry for the off-topic post, but this has been bugging me for months

Having recently purchased a Schiit Modi 2 from eBay, just to try out before commiting to something a little more expensive (and reliable).

The Modi 2 has some real issues with Windows 10, I belive the Modi 3 solves all of these issues.

There's an error message when plugging the Modi into Windows which is something like "USB device not recognized, the last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."

## The solution

A hairdryer... yes, I'm being serious. Apply heat directly to the Schiit Modi 2 for 10 - 15 seconds. Then try connecting the Modi to your PC. Ridiculous, I know, but it worked.

Now, I can't take any credit for this solution, the real MVP is [vavvo966](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?members/vavvo966.5405/) who posted [the following ](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/please-help-schiit-modi-2-not-being-recognized-anymore-by-windows.5943/page-2#post-136701)

There's another method which includes replacing the chip, but this involves soldering 100 tiny legs, which I'm not a fan of, but you can find some information [here](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/please-help-schiit-modi-2-not-being-recognized-anymore-by-windows.5943/page-5#post-468079)
