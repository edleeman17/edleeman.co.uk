Cookie Zero is to show you that we don't need to have cookies on our sites. We don't need to track users across the internet. I speak a little bit more about #CookieZero [here](https://edleeman.co.uk/posts/day-4-no-ads/)

Send me your site URL's without Cookies. Display this cool banner on your site.
