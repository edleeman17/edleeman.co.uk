# About me

Hi, I’m Ed. I’m a Platform Engineer based in Portsmouth, UK. I currently work for Stepstone Group.

I am a keen writer over at my main blog The Self-Hosting Blog where I write informative tutorials on how to self-host opensource software. I try to keep the blog posts simple, to try and show my readers how easy it is to spin up their own applications, rather than using centralised software.

My current focuses are home-networking and server hosting.

You’ll find that some of the posts that I have written on my other blog have been cross-posted here.
