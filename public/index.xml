      <title>Day 4 - No Ads</title>

      <description>GoNads I decided not to put ads on the site. They make the site look poo and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sit with me ethically. I did however make 30p which ia just about enough to buy myself a Freddo. Ads suck, in general, and as a source of income. They&amp;rsquo;re spammy, obtrusive and distract the readers from the content that you&amp;rsquo;ve worked so hard to produce.
So, I have made the executive decision not the run ads on The Self-Hosting Blog .</description>

      <description>The Dream Machine The other day, I purchased the Ubiquiti Unifi Dream Machine . A company well known by the guys over at /r/homelab  and /r/homenetworking . Ubiquiti have made a name for themselves in the enterprise world, but over the last few years, more and more homelabbers have taken it upon themselves to set up enterprise grade hardware at home.
Why did I buy The Dream Machine So for me personally, I wanted it just for fun.</description>

      <title>Day 2 - Monetisation</title>

      <description>So, today The Self-Hosting Blog  got approved for monitisation via NitroPay . Which has got me thinking about where I would like to take the blog. I started the blog to be able to document my findings and giver back to the self-hosting community. When I was working on something that didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a presence on Google, I would type up my notes as a tutorial to hopefully save someone else the headache that I went through.</description>

      <description>Hello Hello, this is my first post in the #100DaysToOffload  challenge. The brainchild of Kev Quirk .
I intend to use this space as a chance to improve my writing skills over at The Self-Hosting Blog .
I often find that I struggle to put my thoughts onto paper, and when re-reading what I have written, I feel like it was written by a 5 year old. I would like to improve how I come across on the internet and become a trusted source of knowledge to anyone who wants to know what I have to say.</description>
