<meta name="description" content="Today, we ran out of space on a drive which was running an internal wiki. Unfortunately for us, we lost the docker-compose file which contained the database password used to get the data for our wiki.
Luckily, the container was still running, even if it wasn&rsquo;t we probably could have spun up an old containers using something from docker ps -a.
As the container was still running, we exec&rsquo;d into it with docker exec -it &lt;container_id&gt; bash and we&rsquo;re able to run the env command which revealed the password that was set in the docker-compose file.">

      <p>I have recently discovered that a lot of my posts over at <a 
    href="https://theselfhostingblog.com"
    
    
     
      target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener"

    The Self-Hosting Blog
</a> follow the same passage.</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction about the Software</li>
<li>Provisioning your server</li>
<li>Installing prerequisite requirements</li>
<li>Installing <em>the thing</em></li>
<li>Configuring Nginx</li>
<li>Port forwarding</li>
<li>Certbot</li>
<li>Recap</li>
</ol>
<p>The only thing that really changes is step 4, maybe step 3 depending on whether Docker is required or not.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t I automating this.</p>
<p>I think I know why, the content will be shite. It&rsquo;ll lack personal touch.</p>
<p>Yes it&rsquo;s repetitive, but then again, the service that I am providing is to walk someone through how to set this stuff up. It is very similar between projects.
If I was to extract the repetitive steps into another blog post, my main blog posts would lack the content. It&rsquo;ll just be &ldquo;Run this Docker Compose script&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Basically I keep contradicting myself. I&rsquo;m worried about SEO rankings if I plagiarise my own content too much. But I&rsquo;m also worried about lacking the content to be ranked by SEO.</p>
<p>I think my posts perform better when I write them from scratch. My tutorials on self-hosting <a

    Bitwarden

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to balance time with reward. I think I need to pick one.</p>
