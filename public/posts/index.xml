      <description>Hello Hello, this is my first post in the #100DaysToOffload  challenge. The brainchild of Kev Quirk .
I intend to use this space as a chance to improve my writing skills over at The Self-Hosting Blog .
I often find that I struggle to put my thoughts onto paper, and when re-reading what I have written, I feel like it was written by a 5 year old. I would like to improve how I come across on the internet and become a trusted source of knowledge to anyone who wants to know what I have to say.</description>
