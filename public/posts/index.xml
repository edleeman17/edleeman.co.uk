      <description>So, today The Self-Hosting Blog  got approved for monitisation via NitroPay . Which has got me thinking about where I would like to take the blog. I started the blog to be able to document my findings and giver back to the self-hosting community. When I was working on something that didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a presence on Google, I would type up my notes as a tutorial to hopefully save someone else the headache that I went through.</description>

      <description>Hello Hello, this is my first post in the #100DaysToOffload  challenge. The brainchild of Kev Quirk .
I intend to use this space as a chance to improve my writing skills over at The Self-Hosting Blog .
I often find that I struggle to put my thoughts onto paper, and when re-reading what I have written, I feel like it was written by a 5 year old. I would like to improve how I come across on the internet and become a trusted source of knowledge to anyone who wants to know what I have to say.</description>
