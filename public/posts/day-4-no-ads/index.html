<meta name="description" content="So, today The Self-Hosting Blog  got approved for monitisation via NitroPay . Which has got me thinking about where I would like to take the blog. I started the blog to be able to document my findings and giver back to the self-hosting community. When I was working on something that didn&rsquo;t have much of a presence on Google, I would type up my notes as a tutorial to hopefully save someone else the headache that I went through.">

      <h1 id="gonads">GoNads</h1>
<p>I decided not to put ads on the site. They make the site look poo and it doesn&rsquo;t sit with me ethically. I did however make 30p which ia just about enough to buy myself a Freddo. Ads suck, in general, and as a source of income. They&rsquo;re spammy, obtrusive and distract the readers from the content that you&rsquo;ve worked so hard to produce.</p>
<p>So, I have made the executive decision not the run ads on <a

    The Self-Hosting Blog
</a>. There is, however, a <a

      target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener"
    
>
    buy me a coffee
</a> link for anyone feeling super generous.</p>
<p>Without running ads, I do have some bragging rights as I believe there&rsquo;s one maybe two cookies on the entire site. Until you open the buy me a coffee widget that is. I&rsquo;ve added the BMC link to the footer of my site, so I might see how it performs there and ditch the widget. Then it&rsquo;ll definitely only be one or two cookies.</p>
<h1 id="cookiezero">CookieZero</h1>
<p>I want to start a movement. #CookieZero (bit like Inbox Zero I guess)</p>
<p>You heard it here first, I will build a site to showcase us fellow content creators who can achieve #CookieZero. Let&rsquo;s take back privacy on the web.</p>
<p>Send me your blog urls with #CookieZero and I will add you to the hall of fame (once I have built the site). Either in the comments below, or through <a
