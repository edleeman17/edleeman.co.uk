          <div class="summary">I have been playing around with Bash over the last 24 hours, which has had its highs and lows.
I still don’t understand when to echo a variable into another variable and when to do a direct assignment. But it’s early days for me. I’m looking to take a more architectural approach to my day job, which means spending even more time in the Linux environment. I’d like to automate a lot of my repetitive tasks, reason 1 being that I save some time, reason 2 being that I will definitely forget to do the task.</div>

          <div class="summary">We got our first sponsorship on The Self-Hosting Blog , albeit, my parter! But it was a nice surprise and I didn’t ask for it! Even though it shouldn’t officially count, something inside me is feeling motivated, almost like it was all worth it, you know?
With the blog, we’re going to have a guest blogger. He’s Piete, over at https://www.pietersartain.com  who is doing some really cool stuff with Ansible at the moment.</div>

          <div class="summary">I have recently discovered that a lot of my posts over at The Self-Hosting Blog  follow the same passage.
 Introduction about the Software Provisioning your server Installing prerequisite requirements Installing the thing Configuring Nginx Port forwarding Certbot Recap  The only thing that really changes is step 4, maybe step 3 depending on whether Docker is required or not.
Why aren’t I automating this.
I think I know why, the content will be shite.</div>

          <div class="summary">A friend of mine has recently set up his own virtual server. Which allows him to run 3 virtual machines on a single machine. He has spoken about it over on his blog . There are 4 parts to the series which go through picking the parts, technical challenges, and finally the end result. It’s a really interesting read, I’d highly recommend checking it out.
He’s using Proxmox, which I have some experience with, but not to the extent of what he has managed to achieve with it.</div>

          <div class="summary">I’m starting to enjoy writing these blog posts. I mean, I enjoy writing, I just haven’t been very good at it. I often struggle with trying to think of an idea to write about, but I’m five days in now and haven’t run out of ideas yet! I think I’m finding my flow now. I have already met so many interesting people as a result of #100DaysToOffLoad. The guys over at Fosstodon.</div>

          </div>

          <div class="summary">GoNads I decided not to put ads on the site. They make the site look poo and it doesn’t sit with me ethically. I did however make 30p which ia just about enough to buy myself a Freddo. Ads suck, in general, and as a source of income. They’re spammy, obtrusive and distract the readers from the content that you’ve worked so hard to produce.
So, I have made the executive decision not the run ads on The Self-Hosting Blog .</div>

          <div class="summary">The Dream Machine The other day, I purchased the Ubiquiti Unifi Dream Machine . A company well known by the guys over at /r/homelab  and /r/homenetworking . Ubiquiti have made a name for themselves in the enterprise world, but over the last few years, more and more homelabbers have taken it upon themselves to set up enterprise grade hardware at home.
Why did I buy The Dream Machine So for me personally, I wanted it just for fun.</div>

          <div class="summary">So, today The Self-Hosting Blog  got approved for monitisation via NitroPay . Which has got me thinking about where I would like to take the blog. I started the blog to be able to document my findings and giver back to the self-hosting community. When I was working on something that didn’t have much of a presence on Google, I would type up my notes as a tutorial to hopefully save someone else the headache that I went through.</div>
